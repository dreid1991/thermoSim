HEY - for wall collision, just do like if if dotProd with perp of now * dotProd of perp with next < 0, reflect!

check out comment it LevelTools.gravity.  There may be a problem with gravity.
attracting is gaining energy in at least cvcp - response: seems stable with ~200 dots in static container

Stuff to do
-hypo path
-loading graphs (command?)


performance notes - .apply() is trivially slower than just calling the function.  However
.apply(someVar) is ~ 20% slower.  Same if you just use undefined.  May be lookup time or something.  Still takes trivially little time (400 - 800 ms per million.  ~400 for apply(), ~800 for apply(someVar))

Make slow down time thing by multiplying v (and piston motion, dividing by const for pInt) by const
Make buttons smaller



do some gridding on graphs to make each layer item have its erase and draw closer together

do something in liquid update to update phase diagram if pressure changed

make it so you can fix axes more precisely.  Maybe have {min step max} and set num grid lines based on that

make custom button column

many activity coeffs more flexible

get rid of 'hit mode' (32 vs std) thing

fix cVAdiabatic for variable heat capacity

make isothermal init make option to hold at current temp
